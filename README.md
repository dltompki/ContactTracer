# Fighting COVID-19 With Data
**Contact Tracer** is an app designed to store data collected by the user about their interactions during a pandemic, so that in the event of the user being tested positive, they can provide health officals with as much information as possible to help them contain the spread.
## Motivation
Obiously the outbreak of coronavirus is a big deal, and the main motivation for this project, but there some other stuff too.
### [Code: Buffalo Hackathon](https://www.43north.org/code-buffalo/)
This project is part of my first time participating in a Hackathon. With the prompt of "helping the community", that is the big picture goal for this project.
### Learning New Technologies
In order to build this app, I have had to teach myself a few new things. Here's a list, with links for refrence:
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
## Execution
**Contact Tracer** is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), an SDK created by Google for the fast development of apps for a multitude of platforms, including Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop. The language used to program all of these platforms simultaneously is [Dart](https://dart.dev/).
